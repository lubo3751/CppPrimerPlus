Provide method definitions for the class described in Chapter Review Question 5
and write a short program that illustrates all the features.

Chapter Review 5:
Define a class to represent a bank account. Data members should include the
depositor’s name, the account number (use a string), and the balance. Member functions
should allow the following:

    Creating an object and initializing it.
    Displaying the depositor’s name, account number, and balance
    Depositing an amount of money given by an argument
    Withdrawing an amount of money given by an argument

Just show the class declaration, not the method implementations. (Programming
Exercise 1 provides you with an opportunity to write the implementation.)
