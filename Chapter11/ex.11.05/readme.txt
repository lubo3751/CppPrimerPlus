Rewrite the Stonewt class (Listings 11.16 and 11.17) so that it has a state member
that governs whether the object is interpreted in stone form, integer pounds form,
or floating-point pounds form. Overload the << operator to replace the
show_stn() and show_lbs() methods. Overload the addition, subtraction, and
multiplication operators so that one can add, subtract, and multiply Stonewt values.
Test your class with a short program that uses all the class methods and friends.
